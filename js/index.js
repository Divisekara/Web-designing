//this is my first javascript

let name = 'asitha';

console.log(name);

//name cannot to be a reserved keyword
//Variable should be meaningful
//cannot start with a number
//cannot contain a space or a hyphen -
//case sensitive
//camel notation

let firstName, secondName;

let thirdName='asitha', fourthName = 'diviya'
//but the best practise is to use a single line for a single variable defining
